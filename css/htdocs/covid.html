The pandemic of such a large scale caused economic shutdowns, large-scale standstills, and more importantly, loss of life wherever you go. This pandemic is said to have changed the path of history for its wide effects on mankind. However, as vaccines are continuously being handed out, the effects we feel are slowly coming to a halt. That said, the advent of a new variant called Omicron is on its way to slow that impending normalization, as it wreaks more havoc across the globe. (WHO, 2021).</p>
