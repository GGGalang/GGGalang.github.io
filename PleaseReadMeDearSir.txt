Hello Sir! If you're reading this, great!

This letter is just to address the theme of AA2 regarding translations. First off, I didn't do new translations to the site because my site already fulfilled that
requirement. Inside every page, there's a scrolling piece of text that serves as breaking news to all viewers. That is made of translation.

Another example of translation on the site is the sidebar: its opening and closing animation is from translation. Other than that,
there's also the easter eggs, especially the one in the search results site.

Other than that, it's hard to think of a good application of translation for the website. After all, it's a news website; there aren't a lot of places
where you can use animation on it.

Onto other news, "Any future plans?"

A good idea I had was to make the creation of articles a lot easier. It's semi-modular now in the code which makes it easy for everyone to make articles,
but I mean a LOT more easier. To the level where you can make articles directly from the site itself. That would be cool, but very, very, VERY complicated, I already
know. I might have to make some sort of database to store all that, and I'm not sure if I want to dive into the complicated world of DBs such as MongoDB.

Another, simpler(?) idea is to USE TEXT FILES in order to store article content. I can probably "kind of" do something like this by using javascript,
but I need a way where ALL article text is stored in ONE text file AND be able to APPLY STYLES on the text. Current methods I saw were embedding a text
file with html/js but that embeds the WHOLE file. I need only certain lines of text. Furthermore, some solutions offered on sites like Stack overflow
don't allow styles to be applied. If I want to make this good idea a reality, I need to do more research, maybe use a few libraries, who knows.

There are more ideas in store for the future of this website, but for now, this is what we have. Cheers!
