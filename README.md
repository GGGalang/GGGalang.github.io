# GGGalang.github.io
The repository host for the PASAMA Project. Contains small edits and configurations from the original for hosting.

If you want the original PASAMA Project, click [this link right here](https://github.com/GGGalang/2QProjArgonGalang.git).

Updates from original project to this repo created to host might take a while to load, since I have to merge them and all. Still better than replit!
